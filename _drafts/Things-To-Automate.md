Thinking more about automation on a personal level, I'm finding myself wondering how far I could take this? And how far is too far?

Things I Definitely Want to Automate:
- Retirement Savings
- Tax Record Keeping
- Repetitive tasks such as getting this blog from my computer to yours.
- Rent and Utility Payments

Things I Am Not Sure About Automating:
- Investments
- Recurring Subscription Services (both entertainment and professional)
- Notes from books and podcasts

While the top list loses almost nothing from being automated away, the bottom list does. So the question becomes do you want to spend your time thinking and learning about investing, whether to re-subscribe to Netflix this month or next month to save $10, and did you remember to take the notes from The Bullet Journal Book?

Wow, the answer is very obviously **NO**. I would rather be thinking or doing many other things (or perhaps not do anything for a few minutes).  

Automate everything!
