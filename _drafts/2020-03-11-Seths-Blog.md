If you read this blog daily and do not read [Seths Godin's blog](https://www.seths.blog). I beg you to do the opposite. If you sill feel like reading my afterwards, great. But please please read his first. I will not do the disservice of trying to describe it. I will only say that I greatly value getting to look at the world through his eyeballs every single day. I hope you enjoy.
