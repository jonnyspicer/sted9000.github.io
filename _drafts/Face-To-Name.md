To _put a face to the name_ is a strange phenomenon when you think about it. Before you saw the face, did you imagine a person without a face? A person with a generic manikin face? Or did you piece together clues and render a face? This highlights how dreamlike our imaginations are. And yet we don't often notice.

We conjure futures, ideas, and unknown people in our minds and when the future becomes the present what happens? Usually nothing of note - magic.
