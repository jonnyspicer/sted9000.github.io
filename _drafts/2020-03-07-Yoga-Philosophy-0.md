I am thoroughly enjoying my basic yoga routine. My body feels powerful and relaxed and my mind feels renewed and fresh after each practice.

Wanting to go a bit deeper, I picked up a yoga book. Not sure that was a good idea.

I want to document my first impressions here and see if they change over time.

- The principles are inspiring and motivating - lean into pain rather than turn away, consistency, body-mind connection, self responsibility, etc.     

- The philosophical doctrine seems beyond silly. Woo-woo beyond belief. Where you can take other religious ideas as metaphor, it is hard to see the metaphor implied by _blocked emotions are located in charka x, y, or z_.  

- Similar in some areas to Buddhism - uprooting negative aspects of the mind and the emphasis on experience as the highest form of knowledge.

Going to stick with the book and the practice and see if I can't separate what I perceive as dogma from the real benefits.
