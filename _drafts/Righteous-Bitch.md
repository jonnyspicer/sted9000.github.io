So one of two things is being confirmed. I will let future Ted be the judge.

I have been in pain over the last few days. Shingles. A constant pain in my abdomen along with a sharp pain if I somehow happen to forget to be perfectly still.

I have also been complaining, moaning, getting angry, being a bad partner, and just generally being a miserable fuck.

So...

Either, my suspicion that people with my current disposition (miserable fuck) deserve extra tolerance and compassion because they are likely suffering from my current condition (physical pain). Or, regardless of pain, I am just a miserable fuck at times and random others are too.

Future Ted, what say you?
