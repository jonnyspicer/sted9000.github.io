title: "Food and Life"

I am finding it is hard to encapsulate any real wisdom regarding the role of food in our lives. It cuts across too many domains - social, economic, biological, scientific, and philosophical.

But I really want to plant some flags and have some strong positions here. As not having a solid and stable relationship with food seems to be a large source of discontent for myself and many many loved ones.

My (few) initial leads are moderation, being kind to yourself, understanding habits and addiction, and developing an appreciation of what modern research has to say on the biological side.
