I know:

> Compound interest is the eighth wonder of the world. - A Einstein

> An investment in knowledge pays the best interest. - B Franklin

And when I meditate on slow daily incremental progress towards my goals and character, I get excited.

I find it so daunting to do. To inch forward every day.

But I know that it's not going away. It's the obstacle. It's resistance. It's part of the game :+)
