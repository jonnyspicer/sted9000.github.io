I am tired of the split second of panic and dread when I reach down into my pocket and my keys are not there.

Only to have them be in the other pocket.

While eventually mindfulness is the answer to this all to frequent even, in the meantime a more practical measure will be taken: Keys always in the right-hand pocket.
