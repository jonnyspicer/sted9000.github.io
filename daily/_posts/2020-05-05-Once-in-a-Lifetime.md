I am not in the blogging mood today. So will keep it short and sweet (pun incoming).

Sloppy-Fat-Ted was reading on the sofa this morning. After gobbling down a sweet pastry and not wanting to get up to wash his hands, he wiped them down his pant leg.

The story gets better.

A piece of sugar, around the size of a small diamond, catapulted from said pant leg into his mouth which was open no wider than one centimeter. Once in a lifetime shot.

Sloppy-Fat-Ted was now Sloppy-Fat-Happy-Ted.
