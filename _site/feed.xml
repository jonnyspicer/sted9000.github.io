        <title>Algebra Of Happiness - Money</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In the Algebra of Happiness, Scott Galloway has a unique and honest perspective regarding finances and wealth. Having been shaped by the experience of his single mother getting cancer and him not being a good position to support her, he makes a strong case for financial security being a necessity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;We were under-insured, and I didn’t have any contacts who were doctors. I felt a rush of emotions, but mostly I wished I had more money and influence. I knew that wealth, among other things, brought contacts and access to a different level of healthcare. We had neither.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He says the idea of ‘follow you passion’ is bullshit.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;… people who tell you to follow your passion are already rich.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And rather than choosing a profession based on passion, he acknowledges other darker motives that should inform your choice.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The rewards and recognition that stem from being great at something will make you passionate about whatever that something is.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;He plays high-stakes, funding and founding companies, but also recognizes that rich is relative. Wealth is not only related to your income. It is also related to your &lt;em&gt;burn&lt;/em&gt;. He says his father is rich, because he collects 50k a year in retirement and spends 40k.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The definition of ‘rich’ is having passive income greater than your burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Young people are 100 percent focused on their earnings. Adults also focus on their burn.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And on a comical note (the book is quite funny) he dispels the idea that once you are filthy rich you will relax because you no longer need to worry about finances.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Wealthy people claim they don’t think much about money. That’s bullshit – they are obsessed with money.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ideas, in my own words, to take to heart: Wealth matters, if not for you than for your loved ones. Passion will come as you get bad-ass-good at anything (the point made by Cal Newport in &lt;em&gt;So Good They Can’t Ignore You&lt;/em&gt;). Who cares if the passion comes from the profession itself or from the fact that you are good at it. If passive income - burn &amp;gt; 0: then you are rich. Don’t envy rich people thinking they don’t stress about money.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Ashtanga Notes</title>
        <description>&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Emphasis on the breathing over the perfection of the physical form.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Physical discomfort is a big part of the practice, but you should never experience pain in your joints.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use the breath and the point you rest your eyes (drishti) as tools to help you develop concentration during your practice.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;The body’s wisdom lies in it’s pervasive truthfulness, and the yogi’s wisdom lies in the willingness to listen tot h body’s sometimes superior sense of itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;This form of yoga instructs you to practice 6 days a week. A lot. However it is a ‘non-guided’ and you repeat the same movements daily you can go at your own pace and level depending on how your body is feeling.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Learning to constantly accept physical pains and not instinctively turn away. Finding the space between the stimulus and the response.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Like other physical skills, there are no shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;A definition of yoga: The process by which the impossible becomes possible and the possible over a long period of time becomes easy.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Another definition of yoga: The ability to maintain a singular point of attention.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Algebra Of Happiness Intro</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently finished a &lt;em&gt;self help&lt;/em&gt; book of a different sort. Normally I consume flavors of Buddhist philosophy with varying narratives and covers. Thoughts are silly and ultimately uncontrollable. Emotions are fleeting. Material striving is unwise. Attachment is the root of discontent…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Algebra of Happiness by Scott Galloway is not one of those books, yet I thoroughly enjoyed it and believe it is packed with nuggets that I would be wise to reflect on and take to heart. So let’s do just that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Intro / Background: The author is a business school professor and a serial founder. He is sort of an asshole (admittedly and as a side note we need another word for &lt;em&gt;self-aware assholes&lt;/em&gt; as they are very very different than unaware ones). He had what I would call an American upbringing - divorced family, normal adolescence interests, and an unremarkable performance at a public university. All in all he seems like someone I can somewhat relate to and would like to sit and have a beer with. And this book is what I would expect him to spit out if I were to buy him a few and pick his brain.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>COVID 19</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My blogging-partner-in-crime and I agreed that our blogs would remain uncontaminated by the virus. Sealed off from infection and wholly uninterested.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sorry I can’t resist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now a few days into quarantine and luckily a week ahead wide-spread contamination (possibly) here in Argentina, I want to take some notes to reflect upon at a later date.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;We are really bad as addressing certain classes of problems, both on an individual and a societal level.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;I quite like staying at home 24/7, as I’m finding it very productive, meaningful, and sanity producing. The trade-offs are real and evident, but I imagine after this hole thing is over I will spend more time at home than before.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;This thing is horrible. Hundreds of thousands or millions could potentially die. However there are silver-linings to be found everywhere and it is not just naive optimism to say so.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Health, character, and experts all get badmouthed or dismissed during the good-times. They are all treasures in crisis.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Neighbors are important.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is extremely hard to not touch your face.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;It is difficult to weigh and factor in new and &lt;em&gt;invisible enemies&lt;/em&gt; into your life, but not at all impossible. Our ability to imagine and solve abstract problems is truly wonderful one of the coolest things about being human.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

        <title>Spoiled Americans</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;My favorite political analyst and a thoughtful random woman both recently emphasized the joys of a predictable and stable government and the detriments of an unpredictable one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here in Argentina, for as long as people can remember governments have been unpredictable and unstable. Just recently the newly elected administration imposed a flat 30% sales-tax on goods charged in dollars. The prior administration unpegged the local currency from artificial rates (and ridiculous) rates and the country saw a 400% devaluation and corresponding inflation over four years. In the 80’s the military took charge of the government and many thousands of political opponents &lt;em&gt;went missing&lt;/em&gt;. When taking these few examples (of many) onboard you can start to see the benefit of boring, stable, slow-moving government.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We as Americans have been so very fortunate over many generations in this regard. The cost however is that we now take predictability and stability for granted when in fact they are not guaranteed.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Mesa Al Azar</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The other night at a wedding I was sat at the &lt;em&gt;random table&lt;/em&gt;. While a bit dull getting through the introductions, a bit awkward after the expiration for introductions had come and gone, and a bit more cordial than optimal we had small chat that ended in a nice consensus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The topic was the relationship between the family members of the bride. They are nine and display a very unusual bond. The people of the random table took turns describing their own family structure and corresponding relationships. To a man we each got caught up when comparing ours to the brides. In the end we all gave up and concluded that something analogous to being forged in the fire happens to siblings within a family. And we agreed that the best answer to what makes the family of the brides a different is that the fire burned longer and whole lot hotter.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>I Love Kids (part 2875 and 2876)</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;2875 - They are authentic. Not having to catch people fooling themselves in order to fool you is so very great. I love kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;2876 - They bring out the best in you. Who you want to be. Who you should be. I love kids.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Special Categories</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;Never missing a chance to think that I am special, today I thought &lt;em&gt;I am so lucky to have a lot of people in my life that defy categorization. Neither friend nor family is a sufficient word.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While this thought is so silly and obvious to rightfully be called absurd, I would like to think that the underlying sentiment is not too hokey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The sentiment has to do with the fact that the categories of friends and family both are essentially infinite. Within each group you can have such varying relationships and characters. And that while if you asked me “well, is he a friend or a part of your family?” I could answer you, that answer is so zoomed out that it looses most of it’s beauty.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Envy</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;The hippie mind thinks that envy and admiration are different in kind. Envy is not deep, meaningful, or healthy. Admiration is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The practical mind thinks that they are probably very closely related psychologically and that the difference is more fluff that substance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyways… this weekend finding myself covered in envy-admiration, I was struck multiple times by the feeling that I still not who I want to be.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that is quite okay by me.&lt;/p&gt;

        <title>Take Advantage</title>
        <description>&lt;p&gt;In a strange and rare moment yesterday my mind bounced from &lt;em&gt;that doesn’t make any sense&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;Ohhh, I like that about myself&lt;/em&gt;. Let me attempt to explain.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had just finished expressing how I love that I walk everywhere in my life, when I was expressing that one of the things I was looking forward to in the next couple years is the fact that I will spend a lot of time driving.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter, &lt;em&gt;that doesn’t make any sense&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Split second…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enter, &lt;em&gt;wait, that is actually pretty cool. I am not attached to one or the other, rather, I can find joy in taking advantage of both when appropriate&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
