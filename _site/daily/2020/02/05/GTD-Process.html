  <p>The next step of the GTD System is <strong>process</strong>. You have <a href="https://sted9000.github.io/blog/2020/02/02/GTD-Capture.html">captured</a> everything that came across your mind, now it is time to ask <em>what is it and what do I want to do about it?</em></p>

<p>Ideas, worries, and thoughts that you have captured may not have come to you in a very clear or intelligible form. The start of processing is to make clear what the items you have captured are.</p>

<p>Next, ask and answer the question of <em>what do I want to do about it?</em> Here we apply a few conditionals as this can be a big and complicated question:</p>

<p>The first conditional is <em>is it actionable?</em> Is there a physical action to take to move it forward? Categories of items with the response of <em>no, this is not actionable</em> are: <strong>trash</strong>, <strong>reference materials</strong>, <strong>someday-maybe</strong>, and a <strong>reminders/later</strong>. If it is actionable, the next conditional is <em>can it be done in less than 2 minutes?</em> If yes, do it; if no, apply a length conditional of <em>is it more than one step?</em> If yes, this item has now just became a project (congratulations) and goes on your <strong>Projects List</strong>; if only one step, ask <em>what is the physical action required to move this item to completion?</em> and add your response to a list named <strong>Next Actions</strong></p>

<p>Don’t worry, all bold text above will be explained in further detail in later parts of this series and hopefully will be come clear and usable, but this is it for <strong>process</strong>. By asking <em>what is it and what do I want to do about it?</em> you moved what you had already captured towards being where it needs to be to get done, and one step further to actually getting done :)</p>
