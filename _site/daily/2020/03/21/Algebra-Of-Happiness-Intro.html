  <p>I recently finished a <em>self help</em> book of a different sort. Normally I consume flavors of Buddhist philosophy with varying narratives and covers. Thoughts are silly and ultimately uncontrollable. Emotions are fleeting. Material striving is unwise. Attachment is the root of discontent…</p>

<p>The Algebra of Happiness by Scott Galloway is not one of those books, yet I thoroughly enjoyed it and believe it is packed with nuggets that I would be wise to reflect on and take to heart. So let’s do just that.</p>

<p>Intro / Background: The author is a business school professor and a serial founder. He is sort of an asshole (admittedly and as a side note we need another word for <em>self-aware assholes</em> as they are very very different than unaware ones). He had what I would call an American upbringing - divorced family, normal adolescence interests, and an unremarkable performance at a public university. All in all he seems like someone I can somewhat relate to and would like to sit and have a beer with. And this book is what I would expect him to spit out if I were to buy him a few and pick his brain.</p>
