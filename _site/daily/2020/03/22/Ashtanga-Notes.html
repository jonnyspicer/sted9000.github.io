  <p>The body’s wisdom lies in it’s pervasive truthfulness, and the yogi’s wisdom lies in the willingness to listen tot h body’s sometimes superior sense of itself.</p>

  <li>
    <p>This form of yoga instructs you to practice 6 days a week. A lot. However it is a ‘non-guided’ and you repeat the same movements daily you can go at your own pace and level depending on how your body is feeling.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Learning to constantly accept physical pains and not instinctively turn away. Finding the space between the stimulus and the response.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Like other physical skills, there are no shortcuts.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>A definition of yoga: The process by which the impossible becomes possible and the possible over a long period of time becomes easy.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Another definition of yoga: The ability to maintain a singular point of attention.</p>
