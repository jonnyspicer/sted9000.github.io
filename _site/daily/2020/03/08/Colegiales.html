  <p>Just as I am falling in love with my neighborhood here in Buenos Aires, we are moving. While it was not love at first sight - it has taken my a full year and a half to fall in love - I would proudly defend Colegiales as <strong>the best neighborhood</strong> vs any and all willing challengers.</p>

<p>Just to name a few things it has going for it:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A great bakery. Which as the factory for all itâ€™s franchise locations. This is not a trivial factoid, it means that every day some yummy beautiful treat is on sale. 2 for 1.</li>
  <li>A perfect corner grocery store. Organic, with all the essentials, and rarities to inspire you in the kitchen. Also the owner and staff are lovely.</li>
  <li>Coffee shops on almost every corner.</li>
  <li>Local restaurants.</li>
  <li>Little traffic.</li>
  <li>Tree-lined streets.</li>
  <li>A beautiful plaza.</li>
  <li>Easy access to the rest of the city (train stop, buses, subway, city-bikes).</li>
  <li>Cheap rent.</li>
  <li>Multiple places to get a good burger.</li>
  <li>A fancy restaurant for special occasions.</li>
  <li>Bars of every type.</li>
  <li>Lots of schools.</li>
  <li>The streets are always clean.</li>
  <li>A great co-working space.</li>
  <li>Houses, apartments, townhouses.</li>
  <li>A great yoga studio.</li>
  <li>Cheap gyms, expensive gyms and everything in between.</li>
  <li>NO HIPSTERS</li>
</ul>

<p>I could go on and on. But the bottom line is that I have loved living here and will remember fondly the life Colegiales.</p>
