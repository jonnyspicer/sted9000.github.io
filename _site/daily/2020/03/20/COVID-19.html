  <p>My blogging-partner-in-crime and I agreed that our blogs would remain uncontaminated by the virus. Sealed off from infection and wholly uninterested.</p>

<p>Sorry I can’t resist.</p>

<p>Now a few days into quarantine and luckily a week ahead wide-spread contamination (possibly) here in Argentina, I want to take some notes to reflect upon at a later date.</p>

<ul>
  <li>We are really bad as addressing certain classes of problems, both on an individual and a societal level.</li>
  <li>I quite like staying at home 24/7, as I’m finding it very productive, meaningful, and sanity producing. The trade-offs are real and evident, but I imagine after this hole thing is over I will spend more time at home than before.</li>
  <li>This thing is horrible. Hundreds of thousands or millions could potentially die. However there are silver-linings to be found everywhere and it is not just naive optimism to say so.</li>
  <li>Health, character, and experts all get badmouthed or dismissed during the good-times. They are all treasures in crisis.</li>
  <li>Neighbors are important.</li>
  <li>It is extremely hard to not touch your face.</li>
  <li>It is difficult to weigh and factor in new and <em>invisible enemies</em> into your life, but not at all impossible. Our ability to imagine and solve abstract problems is truly wonderful one of the coolest things about being human.</li>
</ul>
