  <p>In large part the book is directed towards aspiring entrepreneurs or business-school students (a relevant topic given his <a href="https://tedslocum.com/daily/2020/03/21/Algebra-Of-Happiness-Intro">background</a>). The author, Scott Galloway, has a lot to say about what separates success from failure, but starts off on a humble note.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The truth about 90+% of entrepreneurs is that we start companies not because we’re so skilled, but because we don’t have the skills to be an effective employee.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>On to his recipe for success.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Successful entrepreneurs checklist: 1 - Can you sign the front, not the back, of checks? 2 - Are you comfortable with public failure? 3 - Do you like to sell? 4 - How risk aggressive are you?</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Signing the front of the check</em> he explains is a counter intuitive and slightly pathological endeavor.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>You will need to pay the company for the right to work your ass off until you can raise money.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He emphasizes selling as a defining feature of an entrepreneur (much like Peter Thiel does in <em>Zero to One</em>). While acknowledging the grimy connotation of sales, he stresses it’s necessity.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The word “entrepreneur” is a synonym for “salesperson”.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You’d better be damn good at selling if you plan to start a business. Selling is calling people who don’t want to hear from you, pretending to like them, getting treated poorly, and then calling them again.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>There has to be a product that doesn’t require you to get out the spoon and publicly eat shit over and over. Actually, no, there isn’t.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Entrepreneurship is a sales job with negative commissions until you raise capital, are profitable, or go out of business – whichever comes first.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The good news: If you like to sell and are good at it, you’ll always make more money, relative to how hard you work, than any of your colleagues, and … they’ll hate you for it.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Ideas, in my own words, to take to heart: What makes successful entrepreneurs interesting is the wide range of skills / personalities traits they have. Necessaries are a tolerance for both risk and humiliation and a willingness for both eating shit now for theoretical gains at a later date and to get down on your knees and sell. Sounds like fun.</p>
