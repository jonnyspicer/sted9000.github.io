  <p>The term <em>influencer</em> always leaves my mouth as a four-letter-word, but I am starting to think that I am wrong in my condemnation. The truth is that I am actively looking for more and better <em>influencers</em> in my life, as I think they are extremely valuable.</p>

<p>Cynically, they are sales-men in disguise, selling you under false or shallow pretenses.</p>

<p>But on the other hand, it is inevitable that we are influenced by those around us (we compare, judge, and envy). So why not choose our <em>influencers</em>.</p>

<p>I suppose the idea is: choose <em>influencers</em>! But carefully and consciously.</p>
