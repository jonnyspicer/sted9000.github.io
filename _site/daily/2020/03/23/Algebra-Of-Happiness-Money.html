  <p>In the Algebra of Happiness, Scott Galloway has a unique and honest perspective regarding finances and wealth. Having been shaped by the experience of his single mother getting cancer and him not being a good position to support her, he makes a strong case for financial security being a necessity.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>We were under-insured, and I didn’t have any contacts who were doctors. I felt a rush of emotions, but mostly I wished I had more money and influence. I knew that wealth, among other things, brought contacts and access to a different level of healthcare. We had neither.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He says the idea of ‘follow you passion’ is bullshit.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>… people who tell you to follow your passion are already rich.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And rather than choosing a profession based on passion, he acknowledges other darker motives that should inform your choice.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The rewards and recognition that stem from being great at something will make you passionate about whatever that something is.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>He plays high-stakes, funding and founding companies, but also recognizes that rich is relative. Wealth is not only related to your income. It is also related to your <em>burn</em>. He says his father is rich, because he collects 50k a year in retirement and spends 40k.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>The definition of ‘rich’ is having passive income greater than your burn.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>Young people are 100 percent focused on their earnings. Adults also focus on their burn.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And on a comical note (the book is quite funny) he dispels the idea that once you are filthy rich you will relax because you no longer need to worry about finances.</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Wealthy people claim they don’t think much about money. That’s bullshit – they are obsessed with money.</p>
</blockquote>

<hr />

<p>Ideas, in my own words, to take to heart: Wealth matters, if not for you than for your loved ones. Passion will come as you get bad-ass-good at anything (the point made by Cal Newport in <em>So Good They Can’t Ignore You</em>). Who cares if the passion comes from the profession itself or from the fact that you are good at it. If passive income - burn &gt; 0: then you are rich. Don’t envy rich people thinking they don’t stress about money.</p>
