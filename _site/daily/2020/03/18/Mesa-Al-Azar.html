  <p>The other night at a wedding I was sat at the <em>random table</em>. While a bit dull getting through the introductions, a bit awkward after the expiration for introductions had come and gone, and a bit more cordial than optimal we had small chat that ended in a nice consensus.</p>

<p>The topic was the relationship between the family members of the bride. They are nine and display a very unusual bond. The people of the random table took turns describing their own family structure and corresponding relationships. To a man we each got caught up when comparing ours to the brides. In the end we all gave up and concluded that something analogous to being forged in the fire happens to siblings within a family. And we agreed that the best answer to what makes the family of the brides a different is that the fire burned longer and whole lot hotter.</p>
