  <p>I remember living in Thailand seeing lot of people with Same Same But Different shirts.
While I still don’t understand what those shirts were trying to convey,
I love anything that illuminates that we have the same questions as those living far in the past.</p>

<p>What matters and why are questions that personally change over your life, but don’t change over hundred of years.
And it is not obvious that we really want answers to those questions,
or if we had them, what would change?</p>
