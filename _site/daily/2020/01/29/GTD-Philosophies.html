  <p>To start, some quotes from the book…</p>

<p>Why:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>There is no reason to ever have the same thought twice, unless you like having that thought.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>The position of perfect readiness: “mind like water”. Imagine throwing a pebble into a still pond. How does the water respond? The answer is, totally appropriately to the force and mass of the input; then it returns to calm. It doesn’t overreact or under react.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Quality of thinking is not the problem:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Upping the quality of your thinking and commitments does not diminish the quantity of potentially relevant and important stuff to manage.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>It is simple:</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>Anything that does not belong where it is, the way it is, is an “open loop”, which will be pulling on your attention if it’s not appropriately managed.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>You must use your mind to get things off your mind.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>…you have to think about your ‘stuff’ more than you realize but not as much as you’re afraid you might.</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“The beginning is half of every action.” - Greek Proverb</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>When is a problem a project? Always.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>To finish, a condensed version in my own words:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Unavoidably, thoughts and problems will come to mind. If you don’t process them they will limit, clutter, distract, and nag your mind. However, if you process them in a considered manner, repetitive thoughts can give way to new and interesting ones and problems can become projects that get done and better your life.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>In part two we will jump into the methods of the system.</p>
