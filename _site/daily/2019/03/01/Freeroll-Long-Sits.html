  <p>25 Sits of one hour or longer before the WSOP starts (What counts as an hour long sit is pretty straightforward: I just have to not get up and leave the room for an hour. I can open my eyes, fidget, give up, and start again all as long as I don’t get up and leave).</p>

<p>My intention is to enjoy the practice and enjoy how it positively impacts my mind (which is a complete mess at the moment) and hopefully someday those around me.</p>

<p>This is one of the few areas of life at the moment that is fuelled by curiosity and mystery. That said it will be a struggle at times (hence the freeroll), but I am very much looking forward it both the practice and where it might lead.</p>

<p>Gl us.</p>
