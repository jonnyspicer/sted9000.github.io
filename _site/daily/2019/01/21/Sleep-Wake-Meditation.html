  <p>I clearly remember on retreat thinking of ways to explain what it was like –
how is a mindful approach through life different from the normal distracted life.
The analogy that clicked was that distracted is to mindful as sleeping is to waking.
At the time I could not really explain why that analogy was apt, but now, learning a bit about sleep I think I can explain my reasoning a bit.</p>

<p>The question was posed: How do you, know that you have slept?</p>

<p>The answer was two-fold: Loss of conscious external awareness and time distortion.</p>

<p>This gives me a good ways to try to explain the difference in mindfulness vs ordinary consciousness.</p>

<p>Warning: The Buddha talk is about to come out…</p>

<h4 id="lack-of-conscious-external-awareness">Lack of Conscious External Awareness:</h4>

<p>Basically, when you are thinking without knowing that you are thinking the external world doesn’t exist to you – your conscious self is in a different world much the same way that your conscious self is in a different world while dreaming.</p>

<p>Trivial example: When your are meditating you always notice when the heat-pump kicks on and shuts off. When you are thinking without knowing that you are thinking you normally do not.</p>

<p>Not so trivial example: When you are meditating you notice how repetitive your patterns of though at. When you are thinking without knowing that you are thinking you normally do not.</p>

<p>Basically the more mindful you are, the more the external world has a chance to appear in your consciousness. Ordinary conscious is too filled with thoughts and stories to be aware of the external world.</p>

<h4 id="time-distortion">Time Distortion</h4>

<p>Shit just slows down when you are meditation and when you are on retreat.</p>
