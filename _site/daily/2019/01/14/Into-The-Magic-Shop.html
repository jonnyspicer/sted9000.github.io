While most books given and received in my house are never read, I actually started this one<sup><a href="#myfootnote1">1</a></sup> and didn’t stop until the back cover.</p>

<p>One sentence review: A fast and inspiring introduction to a secular spiritual life told through a personal narrative with many messages to take away.</p>

<p>My thoughts: I really enjoyed it (thanks Aunt Kim). It was the perfect book to read while taking care of your old stubborn, angry, dying grandfather. The author uses minimal woo-woo when telling his journey, which I appreciated. If I ever have half as much to write about and can do it half as well as he did I will be thrilled.</p>

    <p>“They [mindfulness techniques] can increase focus and help us make decisions more quickly, but without wisdom and insight (opening the heart) the techniques can result in self-absorption, narcissism, and isolation. Our journey isn’t meant to be an inward journey alone, but an outward journey of connection as well.”</p>

  <li>
    <p>“…what was it about Ruth’s teachings that seemed so compelling and I realized that at their core they were about opening the heart. Acting kindly and compassionately with intent.”</p>
