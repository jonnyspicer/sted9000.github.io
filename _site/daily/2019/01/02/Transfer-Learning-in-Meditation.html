  <p>There was an interesting AMA in the <a href="https://reddit.com/r/meditation">meditation subreddit</a> the other day where the point was raised about how meditation transfers to other areas of life. A few recent studies have shown how many cognitive abilities do not transfer as you might have expected. For example, playing and improving at a memory game may have no impact on your memory functions in real life.</p>

<p>The response from the AMA host was</p>
<blockquote>
  <p>“…You get better at precisely what you train. (This is true in the gym too.) Unless your meditation practice changes your response to the full range of experience – mental suffering, physical pain, etc. It can’t possibly “work” in the deepest sense.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>One way to describe my own perceived ‘transfer benefits’ from meditation (although I am increasingly concerned that it is all a placebo) comes from a recent interaction: I was frustrated when something someone said made me angry. Before I could say anything (that I would probably later regret), I noticed that I was angry and that noticing made me less angry and actually strangely calm, as I now felt that I had the option to simply continue listening rather than reacting.  Things like this are becoming increasingly less rare.</p>

<p>But the question remains: what precisely am I training when meditating? And I am not exactly sure how to articulate it quite yet.</p>
