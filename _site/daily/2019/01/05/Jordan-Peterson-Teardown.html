  <p>I love me some Jordan Peterson.
His <a href="https://www.amazon.com/12-Rules-Life-Antidote-Chaos/dp/0345816021/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1546721815&amp;sr=8-1&amp;keywords=jordan+peterson+12+rules+for+life">latest book</a> was my favorite book of 2018, I have watched 10’s of hours of his youtube content, and I even attended two public events where he spoke last year.
To me, his ideas both ring true and hold up to unimpassioned reasoning.</p>

<p>That said, something has always made me very uneasy about him.
Trying to describe the feeling to a friend, the best I could come up with was
“He is very ‘preacherly’.
It’s not that I disagree with many of his ideas or his intentions, but his delivery… it just makes me uneasy.”
I recognize that my uneasiness is not a solid reason for distrust, but yesterday I believe I stumbled upon the reason for this uneasy feeling.
And it is causing me pause.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.ted.com/speakers/chris_anderson_ted">Chris Anderson</a> gave a wonderful interview on <a href="https://www.ted.com/speakers/chris_anderson_ted">The Ezra Klein Show</a> where he said something along the lines of: People gravitate towards others who feel like they do, but can express themselves in a more provocative way.
That’s it.
He is too provocative, unnecessarily.
This sounds like an petty rebuke, but it might have big consequences.</p>
