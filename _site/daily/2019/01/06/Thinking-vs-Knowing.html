  <p><a href="https://www.trustory.io/">Trustory</a> is a platform in development that is aiming to be a truth layer on the internet.
In <a href="https://discourse.trustory.io/t/will-trustory-teach-me-how-to-think/233">this discussion thread</a> members were talking about thinking.
This is what I took away.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>“… I’m realizing is that it is much, much easier to teach someone how to think than to teach them to TO think.” - priyatham</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“…it is important to remember that we learn not only by reading new information, but also by doing things.” - jsrubin</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>“If information was once the grist for ideas, over the last decade it has become competition for them — we have started to prefer knowing things over thinking because knowing has more immediate value…” - Pam (quoting David Friedburg)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>All great points that I want to think more about.</p>

<p>The first and third quotes point to a distinction that I often overlook: knowing is a adjective while thinking is a verb and one is not a replacement for the other.
The second reminds me that thinking is a process and a skill that can be learned by doing it, not only by studying about it.</p>
